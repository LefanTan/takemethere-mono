## Why Astro but not NextJS

NextJS as a framework is definitely way more fleshed out and mature than Astro, since Astro is still in its early stages. NextJS already have support for ISR, page-per-basis SSR and so on while Astro only has support for SSR on an all pages basis. Not ideal.

So why Astro?

1. Astro supports Partial Hydration, NextJS hydrates the entire website even if its mostly static whereelse Astro only hydrates components that needs interactivity. Even better, the built in `client:idle` and `client:visible` can greatly help page performance. In conclusion, better performance on Astro Pages
2. @astrojs/image > @nextjs/image. Simply because astro/image generates images on build instead of runtime.

Astro Developers are also incredibly active, making improvements to Astro everyday possibile. By using Astro, I'm also betting on the team and the framework's future.
