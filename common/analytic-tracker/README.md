## Tracker for TakeMe Links

Tracks user analytics such as clicks, duration, pageview, pages per session, or any other user defined events on a TakeMe Link.

Cookie is used so that refreshes doesn't count towards FirstPageView

Install the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/analytic-tracker) to use a minified version of the script. I've only made this script to be available through NPM just for fun lol.
